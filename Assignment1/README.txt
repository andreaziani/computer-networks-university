The implementation use pthread library, so it requires more flag in compiling time.
To go over that you can compile with the Makefile stored in the client and server folders.

How to compile with makefile:
    navigate between directories until folder "client" (or "server" if you want to compile the server).
    When you are arrived in this folder, write "make" in command line.
    After that the file is correctly compiled, so you can start the server or the client with ./client
    (or ./server if you want to run the server).
